## Description

A readME.md is a very important aspect to your project. It is also the go-to file for anyone to open or view your project. I have created an easy way to makeup a readME.md by only answering a few prompts. All of the information about your Github project will be accessed here.


The motivating factor to creating this generator was so programmers and coders can save the necessary energy and put it into creating code and enhancing projects. Rather than putting that time into making a high quality readME.md, you can focus on the code, I'll take care of the readME.md.

## Installation


Before using this generator you first need to install it. Even before that make sure you have VS-Code, Gitbash, as well as the latest version of node.js already installed onto your pc. If you have those 3 already installed, *Follow these steps:*


**1.** Clone the code preferrably using an SSH from the green button that says *'Code'* at the top of this page

  ![code test](https://github.com/Goobergreve09/read-me-generator/assets/143923830/48d21976-774e-4b38-ba6c-dfc6e2e092c6)
  
**2.** Open gitbash and *'cd'* into the directory you'd like it cloned**
   
**3.** type *'git clone'* and then paste the url previously copied and hit enter
   
**4.** You'll need to install the Node Package manager because it does not come with the copied code. in the command line type *'npm init -y'*
   
**5.** Next - Install the inquirer by typing *'npm install inquirer'* into the command line**
   
**6.** Lastly, once the inquirer has finished install the fs by typing *'npm install fs'* into the command line.

## Usage

Now that you have all the necessary files and applications installed, it's finally time to generator your own high-quality readME.md. In VS.code *Follow these steps.*


**1.** Navigate to the directory of your project and of the copied files
   
**2.** Right-Click on the javascript file titled *'index.js'* and click *'Open Integrated Terminal'*

**3.** type *'node index.js'* into the command line

**4.** Answer the prompts in the command line - Keep in mind these answers are the content of your readME.md file.
  
**5.** Once finished you will see 'README.md created successfully' in green text

**6.** Lastly, checkover your new generated readME.md and make changes directly in the created file as needed!
